# Release v0.1.30

Released on February 10, 2026

## Executive Summary

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Implemented automated release notes publishing with GitHub releases

## Overview

This release establishes the foundation for comprehensive release documentation by introducing a structured release notes directory and automated publishing to GitHub releases.

## Features

### Release Notes Infrastructure

- **Release Notes Directory** - Created a dedicated `release-notes/` directory to house all release documentation with a standardized structure
- **AGENTS.md Guide** - Comprehensive instructions for AI agents to create consistent, high-quality release notes following best practices
- **Index Template** - Central index file (`index.mdx`) to track all releases in reverse chronological order
- **GitHub Integration** - Modified CI workflow to automatically include release notes when creating GitHub releases

### CI/CD Enhancements

- **Automated Publishing** - GitHub releases now automatically include content from corresponding release note files
- **Graceful Fallback** - When no release notes exist for a version, the workflow provides a default message instead of failing
- **Frontmatter Extraction** - Smart parsing of MDX files to extract content while preserving formatting

## Implementation Details

The CI workflow now:
1. Checks for a release notes file matching the version (e.g., `v0.1.30.mdx`)
2. Extracts the content after the frontmatter section
3. Publishes the extracted content as the GitHub release description
4. Falls back to a default message if no release notes are found

## Dependencies

No new external dependencies were added in this release.
